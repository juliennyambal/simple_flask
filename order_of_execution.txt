1 - Build all the api in the folder called "API Calls Examples" -> To just consume a public API. Emphasize on the headers=, the URL, the payload and the different methods that requests has.

2 - app.py -> Introduce flask from hello world to all the Restful methods, through database models. Expose the APIs and consume them with curl, Postman, and python in point 3.
    - Insert the headers 
        headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'charset': 'utf-8'}
    - add books 
        {"name": "book_crazy", "description": "description_crazy", "year": 1989}
        {"name": "mario", "description": "mario's book", "year": 2021}
        {"name": "luigi", "description": "luigi's book", "year": 2023}

3 - access_books.py -> This is to show that we can turn our API into a public API and let the other people to use it
In the code, 
insert_books = ["Book 1", "Book 2", "Book 3", "Book 4", "Book 5", "Book 6"]
insert_description = ["great", "nice", "good", "marvelous", "amazing", "the great one"]
# -> added # insert_books_ages = [2021, 2022, 2023, 2020, 2003, 2000]

# in the for age added
for book, description, age in zip(insert_books, insert_description):
    payload = {"name": book, 
               "description": description, 
-> #added       "year": age}
    response = requests.post(url=f"{url}{get_all_books}", data=dumps(payload), headers=headers, timeout=10)
    print(response)

id = 1
book_id = requests.get(url=f"{url}/books/{id}", timeout=10)
print(book_id.json())
